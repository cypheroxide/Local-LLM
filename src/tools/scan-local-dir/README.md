Here's a `README.md` file for your directory scanning tool that can be used in conjunction with locally hosted LLMs and tools like OpenWeb UI:

# Directory Scanner for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This Python tool scans local or network-accessible directories, listing all files recursively. It is designed to be used with locally hosted LLMs in environments like OpenWeb UI, enabling Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks by indexing or processing the scanned files.

## Features

- **Directory Scanning**: Recursively scans directories, including subdirectories, and returns a list of all files.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages if the directory does not exist or is not valid.
- **Network Accessible Directories**: Supports scanning directories on network-mounted drives or shared folders.
- **Integration Ready**: Can be easily integrated with OpenWeb UI for user interaction and input.

## Requirements

This script uses Python’s built-in libraries, so no external dependencies are required.

- `os`: For traversing and scanning directories.
- `pathlib`: For handling paths in a more Pythonic way.

## Usage

You can use this script to scan any directory on your local machine or network.

### Example Script Usage

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

def scan_directory(directory_path):
    """
    Scans the given directory recursively and returns a list of all files found.

    :param directory_path: The path to the directory to scan (can be local or network).
    :return: A list of full paths to files found in the directory.
    """
    files_list = []

    # Convert the directory path to a Path object
    dir_path = Path(directory_path)

    # Check if the path exists and is a directory
    if not dir_path.exists():
        return f"Error: The directory '{directory_path}' does not exist."
    
    if not dir_path.is_dir():
        return f"Error: '{directory_path}' is not a directory."

    # Traverse the directory and gather all files
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(dir_path):
        for file in files:
            # Full file path
            full_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            files_list.append(full_path)

    return files_list

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example directory path (could be local or network mounted)
    user_directory = input("Enter the directory path to scan: ")

    # Scan the directory
    result = scan_directory(user_directory)

    if isinstance(result, str):
        # If an error occurred, print it
        print(result)
    else:
        # Print out the list of files found
        print(f"Found {len(result)} files:")
        for file in result:
            print(file)
```

### Integration with OpenWeb UI

To use this tool in **OpenWeb UI**, you can create a function like the following to interact with user inputs:

```python
def scan_directory_ui(directory_path):
    """
    Function to be integrated with OpenWeb UI to scan a directory.

    :param directory_path: The path provided by the user through the UI.
    :return: List of files found in the directory or an error message.
    """
    result = scan_directory(directory_path)

    if isinstance(result, str):
        return result  # Return error message to the UI
    else:
        return f"Found {len(result)} files. First 10 files: {result[:10]}"
```

### Example Output

When running the script, the user will input a directory path, and the tool will return a list of files found in that directory. If there’s an error, the appropriate error message will be displayed.

```bash
Enter the directory path to scan: /path/to/directory
Found 25 files:
- /path/to/directory/file1.txt
- /path/to/directory/file2.docx
- /path/to/directory/subdir/file3.pdf
...
```

## Potential Use Cases for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This tool can be extended to perform RAG tasks, where the scanned files are indexed and processed to improve the performance of locally hosted LLMs:

- **Text Extraction**: Extract content from files (e.g., text files, PDFs) and provide them as context for LLM tasks.
- **File Indexing**: Create an index of files for retrieval during LLM conversations.
- **Dynamic Context Retrieval**: Automatically pull relevant information from files based on user queries.
